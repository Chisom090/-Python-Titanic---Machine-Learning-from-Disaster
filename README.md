# Python Â· Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

## About Me
I love data. I am currently studying cybersecurity.

## Project Overview
This project involves predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic using various machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that accurately predicts whether a passenger survived or not based on the features available in the dataset. This project was inspired by the Kaggle competition "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster."

## Data
The dataset used for this project is sourced from the Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition on Kaggle. It includes information such as passenger age, sex, class, and other attributes that are useful for predicting survival.

## Methods
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: To understand the data distribution, detect anomalies, and identify patterns.
- **Feature Engineering**: To create new features and transform existing ones for better model performance.
- **Machine Learning Models**: To build and evaluate various models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and others, to determine the best-performing model for this task.

## Results
The project successfully predicted the survival of Titanic passengers with a high degree of accuracy. The Random Forest model, in particular, showed strong performance in classifying survivors.

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure the dataset is properly formatted and clean.
2. **Model Training**: Use the `train_model.py` script to train various machine learning models on the dataset.
3. **Prediction and Evaluation**: Use the trained models to predict survival on new data and evaluate their performance using various metrics.
